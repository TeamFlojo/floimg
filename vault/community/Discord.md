## Discord vs GitHub

| Use Case            | Where                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick questions     | Discord                                                              |
| Bug reports         | [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FlojoInc/floimg/issues)           |
| Feature discussions | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/FlojoInc/floimg/discussions) |
| Security issues     | [[Security]]                                                         |

Discord is for real-time chat. GitHub Issues and Discussions are better for async, searchable, and tracked conversations.
