# Task: Enhance FloImg Studio Visual Identity

## Task Details

- **Task ID**: T-2026-010
- **Status**: backlog
- **Priority**: p2
- **Created**: 2026-01-09
- **Completed**:

## Description

Customize the canvas area and node styling in FloImg Studio to feel unique and high-quality, moving away from the default React Flow appearance. The goal is to create a distinctive visual identity that signals premium quality rather than a stitched-together collection of npm packages.

Focus areas:

- Canvas background and grid styling
- Node container design (shadows, borders, backgrounds)
- Node header and content typography
- Handle (connection point) styling
- Edge (connection line) appearance
- Overall color palette cohesion with FloImg brand

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Canvas has custom background treatment (not default React Flow grid)
- [ ] Nodes have distinctive, polished visual design
- [ ] Connection handles have custom styling that feels intentional
- [ ] Edge styling is cohesive with overall design language
- [ ] Dark mode styling is premium and consistent
- [ ] Light mode styling maintains same quality level
- [ ] No obvious "default React Flow" appearance remains
