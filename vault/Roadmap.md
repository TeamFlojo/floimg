# Roadmap

Current version: **v0.9.4**

## Now (v0.9.4)

Latest release highlights:

- **26+ workflow templates** - All templates now showcase composability with 2+ nodes
- **Template helper functions** - `getNodeCount()`, `getPipelineTemplates()`, `getTemplatesByComplexity()`
- **New multi-node templates** - responsiveImages, teamHeadshots, screenshotDocs, blogOgImage, emailBanner, appIcons
- **Enhanced existing templates** - QR, chart, diagram, and AI templates upgraded to 4-node workflows

See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

## Next

Work in progress or committed for upcoming releases:

- **Workflow Type System** - Connection validation for node compatibility in visual editor
- **Additional AI transforms** - More Replicate models, improved stability transforms

## Later

Directional ideas (not committed, no timeline):

- Additional AI providers as they become available
- Workflow branching and fan-out (parallel generation → composite)
- Performance optimizations (caching, memory management)
- Community plugin contribution guidelines

## Non-Goals

Explicitly out of scope:

- Real-time image editing UI (use FloImg Studio)
- Traditional photo editing features (use transforms)
- Video processing
